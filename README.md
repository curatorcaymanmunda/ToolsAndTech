Welcome to CaymanMunda
A small sun-drenched island lost in the ocean
A well of adventure and absurdist humour , adventures and uncomfortable truths
A little website for a series of stories , and a Rogues' Gallery living there , a bunch of misfits that fight with heart , laughter and humour

This repository is a repository of the tools that helped create them and their voices. 
The files are here to encourage you to create and craft world to your hearts content .

Yours in mischief and story telling,
The Curator to the Rogues' Gallery of the Cayman Islands.
